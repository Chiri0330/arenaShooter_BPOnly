# arenaShooter_BPOnly

## Description
This project is a simple **Arena Shooter game** built in Unreal Engine. It is a **Player vs AI** setup where the player fights against an enemy AI in a redesigned arena map.  

Originally, the project included a Rubikâ€™s Cube element, but I removed it because it caused lag and memory issues. I also fixed bugs with scoring and elimination: previously the player score and AI elimination were not updating properly. These issues are now resolved through fixes in **Blueprints** and **class details**, making the gameplay flow correctly.

## Features
- **Player vs AI Combat**: AI uses a Behavior Tree and Blackboard to patrol, detect, and attack the player.  
- **Bug Fixes**: Player scoring and AI elimination now update correctly.  
- **Redesigned Map**: Optimized environment for smoother gameplay.  
- **Pickups**: Health and Shield pickups are available for both player and AI.  
- **Blueprint Systems**: Organized event graphs for AI and Player (movement, shooting, damage, health, and shield).  
- **Projectiles**: Player and AI each have working projectile systems with damage feedback.
